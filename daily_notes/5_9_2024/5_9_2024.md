Agenda
- Keras Input Object 
    1. Why is this needed?
    2. What is it?
    3. Examples with different input shapes

Why?
```
input = keras.Input(shape=(input_shape))

for assign weights.

```

Input Layer:

The InputLayer is just a placeholder and does not have any trainable parameters. Hence, the parameter count is 0.
