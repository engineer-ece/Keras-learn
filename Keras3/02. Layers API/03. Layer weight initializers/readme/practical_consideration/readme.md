### Tips for Choosing Initializers

1. **Activation Functions:**
   - **ReLU and Variants (e.g., Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU):** Use `HeNormal` or `HeUniform` to prevent vanishing gradients and maintain activation stability.
   - **Sigmoid and Tanh:** Use `GlorotNormal` or `GlorotUniform` to keep activations and gradients stable across layers.

2. **Layer Type:**
   - **Residual Networks:** Use `Identity` initializer for residual connections to preserve the identity mapping.
   - **RNNs:** Use `Orthogonal` initializer to maintain orthogonality and stabilize training.

3. **Training Stability:**
   - **VarianceScaling:** Adjust the `scale` parameter to ensure proper weight initialization based on layer depth and activation functions.

4. **Deep Networks:**
   - **Leaky ReLU or SELU:** Use `LeCunNormal` or `LeCunUniform` to maintain gradient scaling and activation stability.

5. **Biases vs. Weights:**
   - For biases, initializers like `Zeros` or `Constant` are commonly used.
   - Avoid using `Zeros` or `Ones` for weights to prevent symmetry issues in the model.

Choosing the right initializer can significantly impact the training stability and performance of your neural network. Adjust the initializer based on the specific architecture and activation functions used in your model.
