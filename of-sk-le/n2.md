The **notes.pdf** document you provided contains detailed descriptions of various machine learning algorithms. I'll go through each topic, explaining the steps, theory, and practical use cases step by step, aligning with the contents of the document.

I'll break down these steps in accordance with the sections listed in the notes, from basic algorithms like **Linear Regression** to more complex clustering and ensemble methods such as **K-Means Clustering** and **Random Forest**.

### 1. **Linear Regression**
**Definition**: Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features).

**Steps**:
1. **Hypothesis**: The relationship is modeled by the linear equation \( Y = w_0 + w_1X \), where:
   - \( Y \) is the target,
   - \( X \) is the feature,
   - \( w_0 \) is the intercept, and
   - \( w_1 \) is the slope.
2. **Cost Function**: We use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to quantify how far off predictions are from actual values.
   $$
   MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum (Y_i - \hat{Y_i})^2
   $$
3. **Optimization**: We minimize the cost function using **Gradient Descent**:
   $$
   w_j = w_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J(w)}{\partial w_j}
   $$

**Use Case**: Predicting housing prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, etc.

---

### 2. **Polynomial Regression**
**Definition**: Polynomial regression extends linear regression by fitting a nonlinear relationship between the target and the features. The model is represented as a polynomial equation \( Y = w_0 + w_1X + w_2X^2 + \dots + w_nX^n \).

**Steps**:
1. **Polynomial Features**: Transform the features by introducing polynomial terms (e.g., \( X^2, X^3 \)).
2. **Apply Linear Regression**: Fit a linear model to these transformed features.

**Use Case**: Modeling nonlinear data like economic growth trends, disease progression, or tissue growth.

---

### 3. **Logistic Regression**
**Definition**: Logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome using a sigmoid function, ensuring the output lies between 0 and 1.

**Steps**:
1. **Hypothesis Function**: Use the sigmoid function to map predictions to probabilities.
   $$
   P(y = 1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w_0 + w_1X)}}
   $$
2. **Cost Function**: Use **log-loss** to measure the performance of the model.
3. **Optimization**: Minimize the log-loss using gradient descent.

**Use Case**: Classifying emails as spam or not, disease prediction (e.g., cancer detection).

---

### 4. **Decision Trees**
**Definition**: A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure used for both classification and regression. Each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

**Steps**:
1. **Splitting**: The tree splits the dataset based on the feature that maximizes the reduction of impurity, typically measured by **Gini Impurity** or **Entropy**.
2. **Gini Impurity**: Measures the probability of a wrong classification.
   $$
   Gini = 1 - \sum p_i^2
   $$
3. **Recursive Splitting**: The process continues recursively until stopping criteria (e.g., maximum depth or minimum samples per leaf) are met.

**Use Case**: Predicting customer churn, loan default prediction.

---

### 5. **Random Forest**
**Definition**: Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.

**Steps**:
1. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Randomly select samples from the dataset to create multiple decision trees.
2. **Feature Randomization**: Randomly select subsets of features to create diverse trees.
3. **Aggregation**: For classification, use majority voting; for regression, take the average of predictions.

**Use Case**: Credit scoring, feature importance ranking, and medical diagnosis.

---

### 6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
**Definition**: KNN is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies a data point based on the majority label of its nearest neighbors.

**Steps**:
1. **Compute Distance**: Use Euclidean distance to compute the distance between data points:
   $$
   d(x_i, x_j) = \sqrt{\sum (x_i - x_j)^2}
   $$
2. **Find Neighbors**: Identify the \( k \) nearest neighbors.
3. **Predict**: For classification, assign the label of the majority of the neighbors; for regression, take the mean of the neighbors.

**Use Case**: Handwritten digit recognition, recommendation systems.

---

### 7. **Naive Bayes Classifier**
**Definition**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on **Bayes' Theorem**, assuming independence among features.

**Steps**:
1. **Bayes' Theorem**: 
   $$
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
   $$
2. **Class Conditional Probability**: Calculate the likelihood of each feature given a class label.
3. **Prediction**: Choose the class with the highest posterior probability.

**Use Case**: Text classification (spam detection), sentiment analysis.

---

### 8. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
**Definition**: SVM is a classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes.

**Steps**:
1. **Optimal Hyperplane**: Solve for the hyperplane that maximizes the margin:
   $$
   \max \frac{2}{||w||}
   $$
2. **Kernel Trick**: Transform the data to a higher-dimensional space to make it linearly separable if necessary.

**Use Case**: Image classification, face recognition.

---

### 9. **K-Means Clustering**
**Definition**: K-Means is an unsupervised algorithm that partitions data into \( K \) clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance.

**Steps**:
1. **Initialize Centroids**: Randomly choose \( K \) centroids.
2. **Assign Clusters**: Assign each point to the nearest centroid.
3. **Update Centroids**: Compute the new centroids based on the cluster members.
4. **Repeat**: Repeat the process until the centroids do not change.

**Use Case**: Customer segmentation, image compression.

---

### 10. **Hierarchical Clustering**
**Definition**: Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters using a tree-like structure called a dendrogram.

**Steps**:
1. **Agglomerative Approach**: Begin with each data point as its own cluster, and iteratively merge the closest clusters.
2. **Linkage Methods**:
   - **Single Linkage**: Minimum distance between points.
   - **Complete Linkage**: Maximum distance between points.
   - **Average Linkage**: Average distance between all pairs of points.

**Use Case**: Document clustering, biological taxonomy.
